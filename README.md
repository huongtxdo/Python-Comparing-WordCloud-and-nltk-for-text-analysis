A personal text analysis project in which I try to identify the main theme of news in Finland throughout the year. 

The first approach is a straightforward use of WordCloud library. While this is easy to use and provide a nice wordcloud visualization, it takes quite long even for such a small dataset.

The second approach is a bit more complicated and includes many more steps to manually tokenize and lemmatize the headlines to find the most common words.

The dataset for can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geometrein/finland-news)
